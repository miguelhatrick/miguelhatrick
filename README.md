___I don't use GitHub. Everything is either in [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/miguelhatrick) or in private repositories!___

I am a professional software developer with extensive experience designing robust, industrial-grade systems focused on logistics, asset management and RFID
technologies.

I specialize in creating "Force Multipliers"—internal tools and systems designed to streamline complex operations and empower teams to work autonomously.

**_"I like to build things that are maintainable and built to last."_**
